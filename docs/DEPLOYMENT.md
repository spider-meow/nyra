# Deployment

Two containers built from one `Dockerfile`, both pointed at the same
Supabase project:

| Target | Command | Contains | Size |
|---|---|---|---|
| `web` | `nyra serve` | API + built interface | small (no Chromium, no torch) |
| `worker` | `nyra worker` | Chromium, CPU torch, the CLIP weights | large |

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
docker compose up -d --scale worker=3   # more organizations processed in parallel
```

Any host that runs containers works (a VPS with compose, Fly.io, Railway,
Render, Kubernetes). Terminate TLS in front of `web` (the platform's load
balancer, or Caddy/nginx). `web` can run several instances; nothing about
a job lives in its memory.

## DigitalOcean

One Droplet runs everything (web, worker, HTTPS, restart of a hung worker); Postgres, Auth and
Storage stay on Supabase.

1. Create a Droplet, Ubuntu 24.04 with the Docker image from the Marketplace, **4 GB / 2 vCPU**
   (Basic, $24/month). Add a DNS A record for your domain pointing at it.
2. `git clone` the repository, copy `.env.example` to `.env`, fill it in, set `NYRA_DOMAIN`
   and `NYRA_PUBLIC_URL=https://<NYRA_DOMAIN>`.
3. `docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.droplet.yml up -d --build`
   (the first build is long: Chromium, torch and the CLIP weights).
4. Do the Supabase setup below, then check `https://<NYRA_DOMAIN>/api/healthz`.
5. Firewall (Networking > Firewalls): inbound 22, 80, 443 only.

`autoheal` reads the Docker socket to restart containers marked `unhealthy`; drop it from
`docker-compose.droplet.yml` if you would rather not give a container that access.

Updating a running Droplet: `git pull`, then the same `docker compose … up -d --build`. If `git pull` refuses
because a file was edited on the Droplet, look at `git diff <file>` first; `git stash` sets the edit aside.

The Droplet keeps no state (no volume but Caddy's certificates; the database, Auth and files are on
Supabase), so it is rebuilt from git and `.env`. Weekly backups of the Droplet are optional; keep a copy of
`.env` elsewhere. A Droplet cannot be resized to a plan with a smaller disk (the 4 GB plan has 80 GB, the
2 GB plans 50–60 GB): going down means creating a new Droplet, pointing the DNS at it, then deleting the old one.

**Measured on 18 October 2026** (`docker stats` on the 4 GB Droplet, during a crawl with CLIP embedding; two
readings, the final peak was not recorded): `worker` 835 MiB then **1.88 GiB**, 150 % of a CPU and 151
processes; `web` 150 MiB; `caddy` and `autoheal` under 15 MiB. About 2 GiB for the containers, before the system.
A 2 GB Droplet does not fit; 4 GB leaves room for one job at a time.

Monthly cost, Basic Droplet prices of October 2026 (check
[digitalocean.com/pricing](https://www.digitalocean.com/pricing/droplets)):

| Setup | Droplet | Backups (weekly, +20%) | Total |
|---|---|---|---|
| Small: 1 worker, a few brands | 4 GB / 2 vCPU, $24 | $4.80 | about $29 |
| Comfortable: `--scale worker=2` | 8 GB / 4 vCPU, $48 | $9.60 | about $58 |
| Split: web apart from the worker | 1 GB, $6 + 4 GB, $24 | | about $30 |

Supabase is billed separately. App Platform also works (web service on `--target web`,
worker component on `--target worker`) but the worker needs at least the 2 GB container ($25) and
more comfortably the 4 GB one ($50), plus the web service ($5-10): roughly twice the Droplet for
the same work. The Droplet is the recommended path.

## Resources

- **web**: 256–512 MB, a fraction of a CPU.
- **worker**: 2 GB RAM was the estimate; measured at 1.9 GiB in use during a crawl with CLIP, so plan on 4 GB
  for the machine (see the measure above), 2 vCPU. `shm_size: 1gb`
  for Chromium. Crawl speed scales with `crawl.concurrency` (3 pages at a
  time by default) until CPU saturates.

## Supabase setup, once

1. **Migrations**: apply `supabase/migrations/` in order (see
   `supabase/README.md`).
2. **Authentication > Providers > Email**: turn off *Allow new users to
   sign up*. Access is by invitation only; the backend has no sign-up
   route, and this closes the direct path through the public anon key.
3. **Authentication > URL Configuration**: *Site URL* = your public
   address; add `<site>/login` and `<site>/set-password` to the
   redirect URLs (invitation and password-reset links land there). Keep
   `<site>/connexion` and `<site>/mot-de-passe` as well: links e-mailed
   before October 2026 still point there, and the app redirects them.
4. **Authentication > Emails > Templates**: paste `supabase/templates/recovery.html`
   (*Reset password*) and `supabase/templates/invite.html` (*Invite user*) with
   the subjects « Nouveau mot de passe — Nyra » and « Votre accès à Nyra ». The
   templates carry no image: mail clients block remote images from unknown senders.
   Supabase's own sender is limited to a few e-mails an hour and to your team's addresses, so a client's
   invitation would not arrive: set **Authentication > Emails > SMTP Settings** to Resend (host
   `smtp.resend.com`, port `465`, user `resend`, password a Resend API key limited to sending, sender an
   address of a domain verified in Resend), and raise the e-mail rate limit under *Rate Limits*.
5. **Environment**: copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill it in, including
   `NYRA_PUBLIC_URL`.
6. **First organization**:

   ```bash
   docker compose run --rm web nyra cloud-provision-org \
     --name "Client" --slug client --admin-email admin@client.com
   ```

## Upgrading an existing deployment

Apply new migrations before starting new containers. From the
`thumbnails_and_flip_hashes` migration on, existing references and site
images are missing thumbnails and mirror hashes; the worker fills them in
with an `index` job. To run one immediately for an organization:

```sql
insert into jobs (org_id, kind) select id, 'index' from organizations where slug = 'client';
```

## Logs and health

Both processes log to stdout (`NYRA_LOG_FORMAT=json` for one JSON object
per line; `SENTRY_DSN` to report server exceptions, `SENTRY_BROWSER_DSN` to
measure and report errors in the browser, with `NYRA_ENV`, `NYRA_RELEASE` and
`SENTRY_TRACES_SAMPLE_RATE`; see `OBSERVABILITY.md`). `web` exposes `GET /api/healthz` (checks
the database) and the image declares a Docker `HEALTHCHECK`. A job that
fails shows its error in the interface and in `jobs.error`; the full
traceback is in the worker's log.

## Staying up

- **A process that exits** is restarted by the platform (`restart: unless-stopped` in compose).
- **A job whose worker died** (crash, redeploy, restart) is noticed after 3 minutes without a
  heartbeat and **put back in the queue**, a crawl resuming where it was, up to 2 times; after that it
  is marked failed, so a job that kills its worker every time cannot loop. A job whose stop was
  requested is not restarted.
- **A hung worker**: the worker touches a file every few seconds and the `worker` image's
  `HEALTHCHECK` reads its age. A platform that restarts unhealthy containers (Fly, Railway, Render,
  Kubernetes) restarts it. Plain `docker compose` only reports `unhealthy`: restart it from
  systemd or a small watcher. Whatever runs the worker, a job running over 6 hours (`JOB_MAX_SECONDS`
  in `cloud/worker.py`) makes it exit, so the restart policy above takes over and the job is retried.
- **No worker at all**: point an uptime monitor (UptimeRobot, Better Stack...) at `GET /api/workerz`.
  It answers 503 when a queued job has waited over 5 minutes while no job runs anywhere. Keep
  `GET /api/healthz` for the web process. The interface already tells an administrator that a task
  waits for a worker after a minute.

## Security checklist

- `.env` holds the service-role key: keep it out of synced folders,
  images (`.dockerignore` excludes it) and screenshots; rotate it if in
  doubt.
- Public sign-up disabled in Supabase (step 2 above).
- Members reviewed every quarter (next section).
- Never set `NYRA_ALLOW_PRIVATE_HOSTS` on a server: it turns off the
  guard that keeps crawls away from private addresses and cloud metadata.
- `crawl.max_pages_limit` in `config.yaml` bounds the cost of any single
  crawl, whatever an organization asks for.

## Reviewing the members

Steps to play by hand (the code gives the list, a person decides): the first time, then every quarter and
whenever a client says someone left.

1. In Supabase (Authentication > Providers > Email), check that *Allow new users to sign up* is **off**.
   Without it anyone holding the public anon key can create an account (without access to any organization,
   but it should not exist).
2. In Nyra, Back office > Comptes: the table "administrateurs d'organisation" gives, per organization, each
   administrator's e-mail, the date they joined and their last sign-in. Ask the client to confirm the list;
   remove (« Retirer ») whoever should not be there, or switch them to « Lecture et validation ».
3. Back office > Platform admins: the list of the Nyra team; remove anyone who left.
4. In Supabase (Authentication > Users), look for accounts nobody invited (unknown e-mail, recent creation
   date) and delete them.

## Vercel (web only)

Vercel can host the **web** process; it cannot host the worker (Chromium,
torch and jobs lasting minutes don't fit serverless functions). Run the
`worker` image somewhere long-lived (Railway, Fly.io, Render, a VPS)
against the same Supabase project.

- `app.py` at the repository root is the entrypoint Vercel detects
  (`app = create_app(settings_from_env())`); `vercel.json` builds the
  interface and ships `frontend/dist`, `config.yaml` and the report
  template with the function.
- Project settings > Environment Variables: `DATABASE_URL`,
  `SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`,
  `SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET` (if legacy), `NYRA_PUBLIC_URL`, and
  `NYRA_DB_POOL_MAX=2` so many small instances don't exhaust the
  Supabase pooler.
- The worker uses the same variables (without `NYRA_DB_POOL_MAX`).
